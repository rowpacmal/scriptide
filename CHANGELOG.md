# Changelog

##### [3.0.0] - January 20, 2025

- Laid the foundation for a redesigned Script IDE, including prototyping improvements to features and UI.

##### [3.0.2] - February 5, 2025

- Updated the write, run, and debug features with a refreshed UI.
- Enhanced script output inspection - clean script, 0xaddress, mxaddress, total instructions, and script variables.
- Improved UX for managing and testing state, prevstate, global variables, signatures, and extra scripts (with experimental script insertion).

###### Known Issues (3.0.2):

- State, prevstate, global variables, and signatures are not persisted between sessions.
- Extra scripts are stored in the browser's local storage and will be lost if the cache is cleared.
- Functions relying on txn input and output are currently non-functional.
- The dapp lacks loading states, potentially leading to a suboptimal user experience during certain operations.
- Performance optimizations are still in progress. Some features have been temporarily limited for performance reasons (maximum 10 workspaces, 8 script files, and 10 extra script slots). These limitations will be removed as the dapp is further optimized.

##### [3.0.4] - February 6, 2025

- Resolved an issue where the `@ADDRESS` global variable was not being set correctly.

##### [3.1.0] - February 14, 2025

- Added a real-time HTML rendering panel. To enable MDS debugging, create a `debug.conf` file with `{ "debug": "...", "host": "...", "port": "...", "uid": "..." }` (customize values as needed). This file is automatically included in the HTML for live preview.
- Workspaces can now be exported and imported as `.zip` files for easy sharing and backup.
- Added support for uploading single files directly within the Explorer Panel.
- Introduced a new panel for streamlined dapp building, script management, and script deployment.
- Image files now open in a dedicated preview mode instead of the editor, supporting zoom-in, zoom-out, and panning.
- Implemented a new file tree structure for better navigation in the Explorer Panel.
- Consolidated all script-related panels into a single **Run and Debug KISS VM** panel.
- Introduced a light mode, which can be toggled in the new **Settings** panel.
- Upgraded the Editor Panel with a new tabbed interface for improved multitasking.
- Added a fresh, single-color icon for the dapp.
- Improved the console, allowing direct execution of Minima commands.
- The interface now retains its previous session state using local storage, ensuring a seamless user experience.

##### [3.1.3] - March 7, 2025

- Restructured the codebase for better organization and maintainability (ongoing).
- Optimized panel state management using state stores, improving performance slightly.
- Improved file tab breadcrumbs, refined tooltip interactions, and made other minor visual improvements.
- Fixed some typos, misspelled titles, words, and phrases.

##### [3.1.4] - March 17, 2025

- Fixed an issue where folders did not expand when creating new files or folders.
- Fixed an issue where the code editor was not cleared when all files were deleted from the workspace.
